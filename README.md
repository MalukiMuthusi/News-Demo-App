# News-Demo-App
This is a News App.  

The App uses data from [News API](https://newsapi.org/)  

I started this project when I was going through Google's [Guide To app Architecture](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide).  

It is also my first Android Application.

This app uses android Architure components that I have learned, such as ViewModel, LiveData, Material Design Components, Navigation Components, Room, Paging, Coroutines, WorkManager.  
And other Libraries such Retrofit, Glide, Mosh...
